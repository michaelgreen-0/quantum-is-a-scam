quantum stocks are severely over valued

(screenshot if im wrong)

i urge everyone to get familiar with classical computing, and then familiarise yourself with qubits in quantum computing

i put use-cases here for testing when i can think of them

in a nutshell, the use-cases for quantum are severely limited and in some cases, classical compute power far outweighs any complexity speedup from using quantum computers. my guess is this will be the case for a loooong time
